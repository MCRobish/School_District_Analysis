# School District Grading Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the impact of different factors, such as spending per student and school type, on the average test scores for math and reading across different high schools. In addition, there was some evidence of academic dishonestly amongst the 9th grade for Thomas High School, so it was requested to have this information removed from the data set. 
## Results of Score Removal

* **How is the Thomas High School summary affected by the removal of 9th grade scores?**
The impact of removing the 9th graders test results is minimal at the school level as well. Though there is some slight variation in the tables below, it is less than a full percentage point. For the table excluding the 9th grade test results, the denominator of the calculation for percentage passing rates was also changed to exclude these students. If these students remained, the score would have decreased significantly.
