# School District Grading Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the impact of different factors, such as spending per student and school type, on the average test scores for math and reading across different high schools. In addition, there was some evidence of academic dishonestly amongst the 9th grade for Thomas High School, so it was requested to have this information removed from the data set. 
* **How is the district summary affected by the removal of THS 9th Grade Scores?** 
Overall, the passing percentages did not significantly change with the removal of the 9th Grade Test Scores. In the table below, the total number of students still includes the 9th graders from Thomas High School because they are still enrolled; however, the average test scores and percentages do not include their results.
